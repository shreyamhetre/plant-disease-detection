# Plant-Disease-Detection


The project aims to develop a plant leaf disease detection and classification system using deep learning techniques

Objective of the Study: The primary objective of this study is to develop a robust and accurate deep learning model capable of classifying plant leaf images into healthy and diseased categories, specifically identifying rust-infected and powdery mildew-infected leaves.

Scope of the Project: The scope of the project includes collecting a dataset of plant leaf images, preprocessing the data, designing and training a CNN model for classification,
evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, and finally, deploying the model for real-world applications.

Algorithm:The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm utilized in this project is a sophisticated deep learning architecture specifically designed for image classification tasks. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features directly from raw pixel data, making them well-suited for analyzing and understanding images.
